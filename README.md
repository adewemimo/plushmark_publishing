## ABOUT THE PROJECT
### Cold Pitch for Project - PlushMark
PlushMark Publishing is a decentralized  borderless peer-to-peer publishing platform that would serve as a level playing ground for writers and would encourage interactions among publishers, authors, translators, editors and reader. It would also provide a mechanism for copyright and licensing of authors' works especially the best ones. Essentially, it is a marketplace for publishers, authors and any interested parties. 
Blockchain technology is considered for this project because of its following features - 
•	decentralization, 
•	Immutable database, 
•	direct payment using cryptocurrency and 
•	inclusion of smart contract.
The platform would be an Ethereum based platform.
The project's scope is 
•	an implementation of a smart contract that handles licensing, sales and/or resales of Tokens which represent copies of digital materials/books and collectible made from bestsellers with inclusion of art and, 
•	integration with decentralized cloud storage.

### Technology Stack









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
